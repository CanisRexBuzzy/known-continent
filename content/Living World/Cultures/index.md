title: Cultural Overview
---
The cultures of the Known Continent are as vast and wonderful as their gods above. This isn't an exhaustive list, as anthropological and historical studies are changing with a frequency, with new discoveries and schools of thought moving towards separating out even these 'macro' ideas of culture.

However, we can most certain enact an understanding of those vast cultural differences within this codex, and break down information where possible. 
# Gaharan
Overall, the Gaharan people are followers of the Zoroastrian deities, opting to host festive gahanbars and swear upon Mithra before enacting their laws and justices. There is division, of course, depending on where you are along the Gaharan Valley. A giant freshwater lake, which plays host to people and monsters alike within its cliff faces.

As such, the Gaharans are overall a people of trade, and a certain predilection to live as prosperously as they can.

Nontheless, these are the larger cultural groupings of the Gaharan Valley and the subsequent lake within. 
## Arkhtaray 
Consider the Arkhtaray people to be cosmopolitan, if such a cosmopolitan lifestyle had a darker edge of class and racial snootiness. Taking their lessons on Gaharan culture from the Kingdom of Varmanstan and those with 'new ideals' high up in ivory towers, the Arkhtaray people are convinced of their own status as heralding in a new age. 

For those who do not ascribe to their methods, they are often seen with a veneer of loathing.

The Arkhtaray people have worked hard to convince these other Gaharan cultures to embrace new ways, but this is often through a method of population displacement and gentrification. 

Originally a smaller population, the collapse of the Gaharan Empire brought a rapid change.
## Besagi 
Otherwise known as Kudakan, or simply Kudak, the people of this valley are centered around the Kudak River within large rising cliff faces, rammed with forestry and rocky deposits of interest. The people here have formed a Trade Confederation, and live incredibly comfortable lives. They pray to the Gaharan gods, and derive some distinction from the rest of their cultural family, despite the large similarities.

Despite their seeming isolation, the Kudak people are far more to keen to embrace the differences of the Known Continent, with Harpies neighbouring Forged and everything in between. 

With working Trade-Tracks and other fantastic ruins, the Besagi people are quickly becoming a pre-industrious society.
## Manganile
The Manganile people are Gaharans of the old ways, and ferociously guard the ruins of great cities within their borders from the outside world, in particular the machinations of the Arkhtaray people and Varmanstan. However they have embraced their Mittil neighbours to the north, and along with the Sosat people, have been influential in the rise of the Beck people, a hybrid of Mittil and Gaharan ideals. 

The Manganile have lost land and history to the Arkhtaray's expansion, and as such have become more isolationist in the past decades. 

This renewed passion to protect the ruins of eras past, have left the Manganile with a greater passion for the past, and have sought to reinvent themselves to a more war-ready peoples, with a greater emphasis on the ancestry of the land and an almost devout study of its warriors.
## Namdhu
The Namdhu people lay at the western extent of the Gahar Lake, and largely ignore the world beyond themselves. Happy to trade with outsiders, that is about the extent of their interests. They don't outright seek their arts, or their inventions. 

Unlike the Sosat and Manganile, they are the most rural- with the most expansive peoples. They are far more pragmatic, and won't go for something unless they can be convinced of the genuine benefits of adopting such a way.

Even their faith is antiquated, by the standards of their peers. Some believe it is their placement as one of the predominant entrances to the Gahar Lake that has caused them to rebutt potential change, a diametric to the Kudak people. 
## Sosat
The Sosat people are losing ground to the Arkhtaray, a once rural-peoples whose population is shifting away to embrace exotic ideals. As such, the weakening of their cultural foundation has left them open for the cosmopoles of the east. 

With a holdout around Grantham Lake, and again in the east of Lake Gahar, some wonder if they'll be able to recover. As such, the Sosat are uncertain of what to do next, as each step seems to do nothing to quell the tide.

Originally, the Sosat people rose out of the old Gaharan Empire as its most populous, and still heralded the beliefs of Daniyal the Serpent and those of the regime. That is, that they could get through the world on diplomacy and betterment of themselves and their neighbours.

# Mittil
The Mittil people are said to have poured out of the Horseshoe Mountains when the age began. This isn't quite true, but it's not wholly incorrect. Instead, the Mittil people erupted across the world from differing homelands.

Only Humans were here on Mittilgart initially, whilst the Zwerg and Alp came from Nidavellir and Ljosalfheimr respectively. As such, the Giants stepped from Jotunheimr, Musphelheimr, whilst the people of Vanir looked on with an interest. 

No matter where you go, you'll find the Mittil people to be particularly hardy, especially those who live in the shadow and sun of the Horsehoe Mountains. They are all warriors, through and through. 

## Beck 
The Beck are a group who have pulled in traditions and ideas and so on from their southern Gaharan Neighbours, leading to a mixture of cultural norms and more. Hardy warriors, capable merchants and navigators of the Sandig desert. 

Most of their population is rural, but the highest concentrations are nearer to Gaharan borders, and along side freshwater lakes and rivers. 

## Der 
The Der are known for living in and around the Horsehoe Mountains, save for its interior. Experts at killing the Undead, they split the responsibilities of maintaining the fortresses of the Mountain with the Bisachtal people. 

They live in isolated villages and towns, and typically trade with the fortresses or some accessible towns. Their food sources are well cared for and cultivated, and everyone there is practically a walking weapon, waiting for the day that the Undead burst free- if it comes.

## Dwalian 
The Dwalians revere their pantheon in much the same way the Pope worships Jesus. They all turn their heads to the Theocratic state of Bisachtal, waiting to hear the High-Priests words. Their language is the closest to the original Mittil tongue, and as akin to Latin. They're largely all warriors, more liable to wear plate and face down fiendish monsters throughout the Mittil lands, whilst also watching the growth of Yggdrasil carefully, its roots anchored into the soils around the Reichrendorf Lake.

# Heros 
The Heros' culture can change from city-state to city-state, but within these regions there are certain cultures of important note, based on the languages within. Whilst it's difficult to map these out, certainly they can be found in day-to-day life. As is, Athens certainly prescribes its own ideals and customs and language to people, basking in the wisdom bestowed upon them.

Their languages are a gift from the gods, all derived from Olympios, the language spoken upon the mountain by its inhabitants. 

Whilst Ares lacks any particular City-State in worship, those who enjoy his existence are typically roving champions and marauders, worshipping the varying faces he takes on. Those seeking glory in pursuit of wondrous fights look to him for courage and a damned good fight.

Whilst Poseidon is worshipped along the coastlines, his following is much more potent in the Triton of Atlantis, in the East. 

And so it goes, with the Heros people divisive in their worship, but recognising the core twelve.
# Dogdarinen
The Dogdarinen are a somewhat unknown bunch. Whilst their lands have been the center of calamity, that saw the fall of the Lord of Char, they haven't been much open what they enjoy, who they are and so on. Known for raiding the coastlines of neighbours and brawling with both pirates and merchants alike. Some have noted similarities between them and the Mittil and Slova people, particularly in their godhood. After all, Ukko and Thor both hammer lightning from the skies. 

But the reality of their deities breaks such a belief. 

Still, they live in some parlay with [[Taranth, the Champion]], and some wonder if they're more concerned with mortality and dragons than their gods. 

But, until the Dogdarinen allow people into their lands correctly, such mysteries will remain. The cliff faces rising thousands of feet that overlook the Gaharan lands don't help much, but they're happy with things the way they are. 
# K'ulqa
The K'ulqa live in terraced hills. Whilst most of their lands don't reach quite as high as others, a pocket in the west overlooking the Gaharan Valley is home to a notorious and feared Red Dragon. No matter, the K'ulqa live fearlessly along the mountain peaks and slopes in their carved cities and step farms. 
# Slova 
The Slova are divvied up between three differing larger cultural groups. The Listolotewda bear similarities to their neighbours in the north-west, as they inhabit mountainous regions connected to the Horseshoe Mountains. Known for their Hussars, mounted atop winged beasts, they strike terror into their enemies. 

Whilst the Novestka and Adacz are differing cultures in their own regards. 
# Kuklil
The Kuklil are a Yucatan people, with rising temples & a boisterous naval capacity, giving the inhabitants of Otherworld and neighbouring peoples a challenge. They are effectively the pirates of the North-East. Their astronomical knowledge borders on obsessive, and this allows them to navigate expertly. Naturally, they draw the frustrations of the Heros and Dwalian people. 

Similar to Heros and the Xochizala, the Kulil live in decentralised cities and towns. This makes it difficult to pin down some of the minor detailing of the culture. 

# Otherworld
Otherworld and its denizens are spread across the Northern Seas, embattled in a duopoly with the Kuklil people. Here, Otherworld's seas shift, along with the landmasses. Only the coastline remains the same, if you can find it. 

To best navigate through Otherworld's influence, you'll need a native. 
## Astal 
The Astal are the closest to the larger central portion of the Known Continent, and have ties to them. Whilst the Cuan are tied up in their naval power, the Astal prefer the quietude of their savannahs and deserts, opting to ignore larger goings on. Hidden villages in worship of enormous trees can be found, but most will be tending to grassland animals and so on.

## Cuan
The Cuan people live within tropical forestry and wetlands. They're a sailing people, who use deception and cunning to master their peninsulas and seas. Their ability to break space, as it were, means their seas are endless for outsiders. They have some dealings with the Ponni people, but largely have skirmishes and conflicts with the Kuklil. 

## Gaeth
The Gaeth are pinned between two worlds- the Gaharan, and the Torobi- with mountains to the south separating them from the Baz, the Gaeth have adapted to the customs of the Torbi Yokai, and there is a strange blending of cultures betwixt these Yokai and the similarly tricky spirits of Otherworld. Migration between the two is frequent, but the Torobi are far more isolationist. 

# Torobi
Study of the Torobi is still underway. Whilst the Torobi are an isolationist people, the rural areas are even more so. Knowledge of the cities is somewhat frequent, but the villages are loath to speak to outsiders. Cornering a Tengu nomad and asking him questions is far easier than it is to corner one of the O-Bakemono in their homes. 

But, we know they have a culture unlike any on the Known Continent, with rulers known as Daimyo sending out agents known as Samurai throughout the region, and into neighbours. 

# Baz 
The Baz are flanked by two large mountain ranges to their north and east, pinning them in on the western portion of the Known Continent. Much of their freshwater flows down into the Bavar lake, and they use the mountains and hills to their advantage, building fortifications within them. 

Somehow, the Baz have managed to enrapture several pantheons at once, with a tension between them all, that puts Baz into a potential powder keg situation. Such an explosion between the gods would either unmake their neighbours, or unmake the lands and its people.

# Xochizala
Inhabiting a wide mix of deserts, grasslands and forestry. The Xochizala have built an enormous city within the freshwater lake of Cinos, whilst their decentralised way of life leads to a mass of cities and towns separated by distance and politics. This leads to an enormous mixture of cultures and beliefs, though the gods' presence hasn't been denied. 

As with their Torobi, Baz and Tavuah neighbours, the Xochizala people are wary of the western desert, where a sleeping Ancient Dragon lurks. 

The Xochizala trade happily with their neighbours also, preferring to do so via the seas, keeping such treasures away from the local lizard. 

The people of the Known Continent have noted similarities in culture to the Kuklil, but they're also pretty unique. 

War drums are stirring however, in Cinos. Talks of a large empire, a united Xochizalan people under the purview of the gods. And potentially even beyond... 

# Tavuah
The Tavuah people are a mixed bunch, adhering to gods who claim to be the oldest within the world. Most laugh at such claims, but the Tavuah people are steadfast in this belief. A series of kingdoms bordering about the desert, the Tavuah people have an explosion of deities in similarity to the Baz, and some believe there to have been a singular creator deity.

As such, the Tavuah are a kind that seems to frustrate others who wish for all the answers in the world. 

# Nilian 
The Nilian people are divided into three most notable cultural groups, with a number of kingdoms within ruled by Pharoahs. They have ancient pyramids, and even more ancient dangers within. They pride themselves of trade with the Silk Road, but none so much as the Hazan.

## Mysamila 
The Mysamilan people stay close to the coastlines, except when guarding markers of interest within the inner grassland. Some settlements are sat upon freshwater sources, but most prefer to sail away about the western continent. They're a peoples frustrated by the encroachment of the Mlak. Those who do not settle are nomadic in nature, moving about on the interior, following the cycle of life. But many more are beginning to settle in place. 

## Mlak 
The Mlak are civilisation builders, having three powerful kingdoms within the core of their cultural homeland. Pharoahs, brothers, have enacted their rule, using religion as a prop to their legitimacy. The gods are silent on this, and religious division is beginning to come to a head. 

They see the rest of the Nilian lands as something to be colonised, in similar vein to the Arkhtaray people of the Gaharan Valley. 

You'll find grandiose cities and memorials here, as well s wondrous temples and so on.

Mlak, it seems, is to find its own destiny, and some believe this is to be in its collapse. 

## Haza 
The Hazan people are famous for their bordering-on-obsession love of the arts. All things pottery, theatre, musical and so on. They have vast museums to exceptional pieces, but also private collections of whatever love its owner has. 

Collecting works even as far as Kuklil. Their kingdoms are smaller, but they have bustling cities of sprawl, colourful and in benefit to the people. It is a wonderful place to be for any thespian. There is a notable cat colony here, in the South-West, under Bastet's watchful eye.

Notably, the Haza reject advancements of technology, and opt to remain as far behind everyone as they can, having once suffered at the hands of a great mechanical monstrosity and its creations. 

# Whenua 
The Whenuan people are said to have sailed here from distant lands, guided by the winds and the waves. They have exceptional ties with the Haza, to the point of a mixed dialect between the two coming to a rise.

The Whenua people are dogged in their relationship with nature, and are notable sailors about their shores, and capable warriors. Skin covered with a distinct tattoo style called Moko, the Whenua are divided into a number of smaller iwi. They have no real alliance to anyone besides their ariki, except perhaps the Haza. 

The Whenua people are proud, and should not be made an enemy of. 
# Bayelsa
The Bayelsa people sit across the southern coastline of the Known Continent, sat astride the Kudak Valley and the Xochizala people. They are happy to trade with others, but as a people they tend to be quite at home where they are, not often travelling much. Not isolationist per se, but more keen to build up what they have. The Bayelsa adhere to a singular creator god, oddly lacking in the world, and then have a large number of conceptual beings or spirits. In fact, ancestry is incredibly important throughout the region.
## Ayeko 
The Ayeko are the westernmost of the Bayelsa people, and lack much in the way of higher-altitude landscape. They are fond of merchants and sailing alike, and will tend to make dealings with the Nilian people in particular. The Ayeko regard their patrons as Orisha. 
## Nyi 
The Nyi are prefer the hard work of the land, opting to farm and mine and so forth. They are peaceful, pacifistic in nature compared to the other large groupings of the Bayelsa. In their tongue, their complex cosmology is known as Vodun. 
## Ozumu
The Ozumu are a particularly crafty bunch, pushing their wares into the neighbouring Kudak Valley to make money. Understandable, really, when your neighbours have so much of it to spare. The Ozumu also look towards a creator deity, and their faith is known as Omenala.

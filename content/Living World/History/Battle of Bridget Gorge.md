In 757, one of the Known Continent's most infamous battle took place between the forces of [[The Lord of Char]] and [[Melika Manesh]]. Whilst their infamous duel lasted merely a day, the battle itself raged for weeks. Manpower from all corners from the [[Young Kingdoms]] streamed in to reinforce this titanic conflict, as the Lord of Char's fires burned without end. 

Melika lead a suicide squad of adventurers into the fray, manging to blast through a weak point in the defenses. 

In the end, Melika fought a vicious duel against her opponent, and struck him down. They weren't able to destroy the [[Divine Avatar]] that gave power to the [[Mortal Avatar]].

Most of the adventuring party, [[Tyrant's Bane]], fell in battle. Two survived, and now live in self-imposed exile elsewhere among the planes. 

As such, the Lord of Char is expected to return. Though nobody knows when. 

The consequences of this engagement ultimately saw a huge decline in the Young Kingdoms.

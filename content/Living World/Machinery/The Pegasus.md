The Pegasus is a Class II Engine rebuilt in Sire for the express purpose of manning the Emerald Line that connects Sire to Handhoo. The Pegasus is largely maintained and operated by Forged, in part because the Pegasus itself is an enormous Forged once it was rebuilt. 

The Pegasus, like all of the Emerald Line's Engines, is an older form of Trade-Track travel. Whilst contemporary Track-Forged make use of a series of inscribed wheels and mechanisms to pull energy from foreign planes, the Pegasus utilises larger Kinetic-Conversion Crystals to provide significant push.

A system similar to how pistols and rifles work.

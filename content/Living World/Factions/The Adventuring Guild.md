"It's a wide, wide world."

# Overview

- Guildhalls are situated in towns and cities throughout the known continent.
- Safe-Havens for registered adventurers
- Maintain peace for innocent people
- Delve into danger that most would not.

# Main Purposes & Goals

- Provide safe havens in the form of Guildhalls.
- Support Adventurers in shifting their loot 
- Help to keep the known continent safe, particularly by working with more specialised Guilds and Groups. 
- Help adventurers thrill-seek safely.

# Leadership & Membership

- In [[The Kudak Valley Confederation]] the Adventurer's Guild is ran by an unknown overseer. However, they have an incredibly intimate knowledge of what lays out there from all these eras past. 
- The faces of the Adventurer's Guild change from region to region, with the South East being hosted by [[Hassan Mehrad]]
- Membership requires a frequent involvement in the affairs, ideally at least one 'adventure' a month. But travel time can cause variation. 

# Locations
Guildhalls are the key establishments. They can sleep a number of people, but these rooms can fill fast at times. They are comfortably compared to a Modest Inn room, but can be better furnished in some regions.

# Publicity & Reputation
The adventurer's guild is largely loved by those who aren't particularly aligned to any one faction, but their reputation varies amongst the different organisations. Overall though, they are adored for their hard work at keeping people safe and uncovering the past.

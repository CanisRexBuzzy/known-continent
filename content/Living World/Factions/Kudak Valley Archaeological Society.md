A gathering of academics from a wide number of fields who have dedicated themselves to studying and protecting the History of the Kudak Valley. They have links with other societies with the same goals, but have a singular purpose towards the valley in bids to understand the rich cultures that came in times past.

# Overview, Purposes & Goals

- Organise Dig Sites & Landmarks
- Host Museums & Heritage Sites
- Educate People About History
- Protect Artefacts From World

# Leadership & Membership

As an academic institution, the society is made up largely of academic individuals and bodies, with some members granted limited responsibility by sponsorship. Most members are low level students or graduates, with a keen interest in learning about the world.

# Locations

They have an office in most Kudakan Cities and Towns, but there are plenty of sites to investigate throughout the valley. In [[Fivakumaaru]], they have a significant presence because of the Arena there. Dandi too has a large scale presence.

# Publicity & Reputation

In general, the public adores them because of the great pains and hoops they go through to make history available. They aren't well loved by The Gilded Dawn, and other factions see them as pains in the ass to their looting sprees and so on.

But in general, they're treated with some reverie.

# Founding & Past History

Founded some three-hundred years ago by the now retired City Elf, Kieran Ihrid.  

# Adversaries & Rivals

They don't really care for anyone, but that's not to say they loathe them- they simply don't give a shit anymore.

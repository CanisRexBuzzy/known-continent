*"Members of the Great Jagras pack, these smaller monsters will flee upon seeing one of their own perish. They are also known for ambushing larger monsters at a moment's notice."*

*"A smaller monster that travels and hunts in packs. Its hide blends in with its forest environment, and it has characteristic spikes on its back. If you chase a few away, the rest will usually follow suit. They tend to keep their distance when large monsters enter their territory, but sometimes the entire group will attack if they feel particularly threatened."*
## Physiology
Jagras are small and slim compared to Great Jagras. Their body shape is very wolf-like in nature, allowing them to move quickly and stand up right for short periods of time. Jagras have light green scales with blue and reddish stripes covering their body, as well as a blue-colored underbelly. 

# Great Jagras
Great Jagras greatly resembles an Iguana. It has yellow scales with orange accents and a bluish underside. It also has a distinct mane of hairs that resemble dreadlocks.

# Personal Experience.
Unfortunately the party haven't truly seen the Jagras in action. At the end of Session Two the party learned that [[Life/Characters/Non-Player Characters/Neutrals/Dragons/Iolth, the Dark|Iolth]] had killed a Great Jagras. Later in Session Three, Iolth would demonstrate his power over the Jagras by ordering them to kill one another at his lair.

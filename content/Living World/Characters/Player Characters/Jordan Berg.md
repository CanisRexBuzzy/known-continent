![[Jordan.webp]]

Jordan is a Dhampir, that is, a half-vampire. He has yet to share how he came to be, and his story remains a mystery to new companions. His people are long dead, and his faith is held only in his hands.

Jordan prays to a god unknown, though his funerary rites and respect for the dead has been observed already by those he will travel with for many years to come. 

Maybe, with new friends, Jordan can alleviate the burden he carries.

![[Garrow.webp]]

Garrow is an inhabitant of Otherworld, the name given to the endless shifting landscapes of the Fae. He is a Green Alp, whose people adapted to the strangeness of Otherworld after their departure from Alfheim some eight-hundred years ago. 

Garrow has travelled to Kir in search of answers, guided by his own intuition. With no awareness of where to go, or what to do, he is merely following Conn for the time being, in hopes that this strange meeting may shine light on what is to come.

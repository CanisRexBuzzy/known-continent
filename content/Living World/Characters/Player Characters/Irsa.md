![[Irsa.webp]]

Irsa is a druid who hails from the Horsehoe Mountains in the north-east of the known continent, overlooking the lands of numerous cultures. The Deran people are known for their steadfast nature against the rough elements, and the undead who make their way out of the cave network within. 

Irsa has been involved in the Golden Moth Carnival for some time, much to their chagrin. With debts to pay off, her service to the Ringmaster, Raj, bears a lot of uncomfortability.

She has since picked up [[Seikiri, Thalorian]] as a companion and friend in this troubled life, and seeks to escape this troubled life. 

Perhaps this meeting with [[Arrian]], and the remainder of the party, will be of benefit to her.

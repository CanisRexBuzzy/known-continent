![[Aziza.webp]]

An orphan from Nilia. She was raised in a Hazan cat colony, and as such exhibits odd behaviours that mark her as one of their own. She is a Half-Alp, and her true heritage is hidden from her. Her constant companion, Timothy, stalks her side- and the small prey. 

Aziza travelled to Kir by boat, and has explored many a coastal town and city along the way. 

Perhaps her strange new friends can illuminate the truth...

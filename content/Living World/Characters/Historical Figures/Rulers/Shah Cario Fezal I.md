Cario Fezal was an individual who is best compared to stubborn grandfathers. Prone to comments inciting conflict, particularly when in relation to the Republics of [[The Kudak Valley Confederation]]. 

His poor diplomacy aside, Cario felt that a focus on faith was critical over finance. And whilst the economy of Kakedhia was still comfortable, it suffered and lagged over time. 

However it also saw the growth of rhe Bard's College in Dandi, and the expansion of The Oval into a genuine place of worship for all. 

Fezal I died some fifteen years ago, and his son, [[Shah Cario Fezal II]], has only managed to get the economy back on track the past three years.

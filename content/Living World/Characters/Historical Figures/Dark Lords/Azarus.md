Azarus was a Dark Lord who ruled from the prior settlement located at the same site as Fivakumaaru. His reach extended throughout much of what is now known as the [[Kudak Valley]]. The [[The Kingdom of Aruria#Anahita Dam|Anahita Dam]] was said to be of special interest to him. 

The remains of his reign, his tyranny, can be found all across this landscape as a malicious layer of history.

Azarus ruled for six-hundred terrible years, and his reign came to a swift end when, in the midst of his pursuit of Godhood, he became blind to the agents of a rival power. 

His kingdom was soon subsumed by the God Among.

Nobody is certain if Azarus is dead, but it is the likely result.

Nightmare is the name given because no other name could be succinct. This God Among took their power from a long extinct deity in a brutal fashion, as to withhold dreams is to deprive the world of joy and creativity. 

Nightmare lacks a mortal presence out of personal instigation, as such, Nightmare has been a long-lived and difficult to put down God Among. 

Nightmare will sweep over villages and towns alike, slowly killing the population through a lack of sleep, and then move on when they become bored.

Nightmare is constantly hunted by a group of Oneiros, known as Terror's Haunting.

The Lord of Char was a God Among who was imprisoned towards the end of the Grim Cycle. 

He escaped his imprisonment roughly a decade ago, and blazed a baleful war on the Young Kingdoms, personally leading his army. 

He was eventually defeated by Melika Manesh, and is widely considered to be dead. Though a number of individuals expect he is soon to return.

If these words are spoken in fear, listen well. For they are not spoken with ease, amongst the many worlds and languages, these two are terms to be feared. They represent the immortals who walk amongst Humans, some are natural forces brought to bear from across the Multiverse whilst others are persons ascended to power. 

Demigods brought to wield a power beyond them, such as [[The Lord of Char]], while others are brought into being to represent a fundamental aspect of reality.

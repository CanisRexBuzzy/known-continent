The Queen of Rain & Time is a God Among who wiped Azarus from the map, and unmade a number of Dark Lords as her power grew.

She was responsible for imprisoning The Lord of Char towards the end of the Grim Cycle. 

The Queen hasn't been seen since the end of the Grim Cycle, leaving many to question what happened to her.

Ancient unknowing entities who seek to maintain their programming. Recreate the landscape to serve their original masters, and remove obstacles as needed. When they initially swept out of their great bunkers, the proto-Haza and Proto-Whenua almost lost their lands, before forcing a counterassault in the great hearts of the bunkers and using newer magics and guerilla tactics to skirmish effectively.

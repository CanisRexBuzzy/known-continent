Asmodeus is a Demon recorded in numerous faiths, myths and so forth. A Demon of notable power, with many avatars serving some hitherto unknown chaos entity. In other forms, Asmodeus is also known as [[Aesma]] or [[Aeshmedai]] across the Known Continent. 

Asmodeus is said to have embittered [[Raphael]] as their nemesis, leading to such bloodier conflicts throughout the Blood Wars. Solomon too, bears a rivalry with Asmodeus.

Asmodeus is said to be a King of Hell, having served under Lucifer. As Asmodeus, there is a lustful element to the demon- and one of wrath and bloodshed.

A Demon of a now-slumberous faith and culture. He is otherwise known as [[Aesma]] or [[Asmodeus|Asmodeus]], though these are all unique avatars of some larger and more deadly representation of Chaos.

Ashmedai is said to be have power on Newol, albeit reduced. Compared to Asmodeus, he is far more good-humoured, appearing often in the light. That isn't to say Aeshmedai is particularly nice. 

Aeshmedai is known as a keen rival of Solomon, with the two sharing a long history, even on Newol.

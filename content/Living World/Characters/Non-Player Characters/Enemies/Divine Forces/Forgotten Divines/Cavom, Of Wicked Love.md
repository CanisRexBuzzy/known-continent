Cavom is an old Deity, one forgotten by those of Newol. He was birthed in the unstable period at the end of the first cycle, following the Post Hedony. he lost his following before the Scale Cycle even began, before even Conn was born.

He has a small shrine in the Holy Site of [[Fivakumaaru]], though nobody is certain to the full extent of his power, with references to his being a god of Marriages and Sorrow. However, his shrine is said to sometimes bear an evil presence.

In the few depictions that have been found, he's often regarded as being beautiful, with tanned skin, shoulder length, curly light grey hair, and eyes the color of amethyst. He is short and broad-shouldered, and typically smiling. He usually wears light and airy robes dyed pale blue.

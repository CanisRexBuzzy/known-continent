![[Taranth's Known Territory V1.webp]]
Taranth is an Adult Orange Dragon whose territory stretches from the Kudak River and all the way along the Dogdarinen Coastline, with a particular interest in the seas. Many experienced sailors along the routes here leave tokens to Taranth, so that he doesn't destroy them.

Taranth subjugated Iolth some years ago, much to the frustrations of the black dragon. Taranth looks on at other nearby dragons such as Vyriss with greed, seeking to take their coastal habitats for himself. 

His greed is well-known, as many hirelings have reported being approached by servants of Taranth with a goal to antagonise Vyriss and other neighbouring dragons.

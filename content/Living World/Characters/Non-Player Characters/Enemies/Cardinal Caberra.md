Cardinal Caberra is a member of the Cult of the Broken Sun, at least up until his death at Oenâ€™s hands in the middle of Folesford. Where he was revealed to be a Vampire to the local people, admin of the city included. His death has caused a large power vacuum across Podan, and has left 15 other Cardinals behind.

Mani is a Gaharan Dwarf who runs the [[The Shepherd's Crook]] in [[Wali]].

She will be excited if the party mentions that they are adventurers or that they're in the town to help with the wolf problem, offering them a free round of drinks and a meal once they've talked to the village council. The people in the inn will also be impressed, though many of the old shepherds will still remain dour and cynical.

Should they ask after Featherock she will direct them to his room, though she will ask them to be gentle with the poor man.

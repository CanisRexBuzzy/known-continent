When Colonial Americans made their venture to Newol, they brought with them their histories. When the Gods came, and rationality ascended out of reach, new ideas took root. Americanists, who foresaw their elders as Deities. 

As time passed, Lady Liberty was born and born again in differing form, until eventually she herself was a genuine goddess. Through the varied Americanist Cults, Lady Liberty is part of a quiet pantheon with a reach across the Multiverse. 

In most visages, Lady Liberty appears as a large oxidised green woman. She may carry a heavy mace, or a fiery torch. No matter what, she is there to bring Liberty to those who have seen it taken.

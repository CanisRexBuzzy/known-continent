Eremir is the Guildmaster for [[The Adventuring Guild]] in Guild. She is a fast-talking, anxious and chaotic individual in her day to day life, with a tendency to steamroll people into performing tasks for her without malicious intent behind it.

She met the party when she tasked them with hunting the Jagras that had been terrorising Kir. When Jordan announced they'd met Iolth, she was panicked.

Nontheless, she ensured the party were signed up to the Adventuring Guild.

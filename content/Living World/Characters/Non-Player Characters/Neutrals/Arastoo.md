Arastoo is a kind-hearted individual with important connections to [[The Adventuring Guild]] and other important factions. 

In his spare time he is known to write poetry, but he is more often than not doing his best to support his people even outside of office hours. 

It's quite common to see Arastoo roaming about the City, simply engaging and spending time amongst the citizens in day to day life. 

He is the Istandar for [[Fivakumaaru]], and also runs the city.

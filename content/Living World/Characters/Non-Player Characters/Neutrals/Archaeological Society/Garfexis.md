Garfexis is a notable wizard and is responsible for oversight of one of the most important digsites in [[Fivakumaaru|Fivakumaaru]], as well as other notable sites of historical interest.

Garfexis is a Light Alp, a sight that is more common amongst the Silk Road than elsewhere. Most Light Alp won't move away from [[Ljosalfheimr]], and remain there, nearer to the light.

Garfexis is a well studied Historian and Archeologist, with a deep ranging knowledge of the past. He has a lacking love for Kings, Queens and other rules as they often want something. 

With a tone that can be best described as a bored drawl, Garfexis has made it clear to the Adventuring Party that he doesn't wish to help them in the way they desire, and that he'd rather focus on his work and studies.

Insofar as to accuse them of harassment. Particularly as they sought to send a message to his mind, cause roses to grow and then send a messenger with a playing card. 

Garrow took psychic damage, the Roses were destroyed and then teleported into the Holy Site to personally let the party know of his frustrations.

However, he will render aid to those who pique his curiosity, or have a vested interest in his people and culture.

In short, Garfexis' knowledge of history and theology makes him a potent ally, if you can keep him on side. Not to mention his awareness of magic as a Wizard.

Dark Elf Commander. In charge of an Elite Unit. She gave warning to [[Aziza]] about using the Light of Alfheim in defense of Light Elves, and explained that it has been used a tool of castes for centuries in [[Ljosalfheimr]]. 

She stayed behind in the [[Fivakumaaru (City)]] sewers, to fight off agents of [[Drazekund]]. As such, she can reappear at any time.

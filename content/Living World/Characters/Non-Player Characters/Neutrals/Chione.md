Chione is a Night Guard for [[The Adventuring Guild]] & [[Fivakumaaru#Kir|Kir]]. She was the first to greet the Party when they arrived at Kir, as they were causing a ruckus outside of the Adventuring Guild. She invited them in and brought [[Life/Characters/Non-Player Characters/Allies/Fundir]] down to get them food.

Chione left them in the capable hands of the Guild as the morning went on, and returned to her home shortly after.

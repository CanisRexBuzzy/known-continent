![[Iolth's Known Territory.webp]]Iolth is a [[Young Black Dragon]], inhabiting the wetlands and forestry around Kakedhia and the Accursed Lowlands. With some reach into the Dogdarinen Plateau further to the east. His territorial reach was once much more prominent.

According to Irsa & Conn, Iolth was subjugated by Taranth, a ferocious Orange Dragon. Iolth is furious about this development. However, Iolth is well known for his patience and sadistic tendencies, and many suspect that Taranth will meet with a terrible end. 
# Session Two 
On the Thirteenth of Mehr 767, Iolth was discovered in his lair. Iolth's sickly-pale-green eyes watched them from the shadows of his cave, before stepping out and soaring down onto the nose of a dead god, face unburied and unveiled to the rainstorm forming above their heads.

He laughed maniacally, the corpse of a Great Jagras and the unconscious form of a Spartoi at the 'mouth' of the face. 

# Session Three
The party attempted to appeal to Iolth's nature towards revenge. It didn't wholly go to plan, as he felt them to be weak, feeble and useless in such a wisdom. 

He taunted them for some time, expressing his views about [[-DM Screen/Multiverse/Newol/Non-Player Characters/Freelance/Chrysanthos]] and others freely. 

He sought to bully and coerce, and retreated when bored of the party. Though he kept an eye on them.

![[Vyriss Territory V1.webp]]
Vyriss is an infamous Ancient Green Dragon, whose territory stretches from the southern banks of the Cuan Sea to the Kudak River and westwards nearer to the lands of the Nilian People. 

With her deep network of informants, spies and more, Vyriss is able to keep her claws on the pulse of the Known Continent. Her interests, as tends to be with Green dragons, is in the natural world and the arts. 

She can often be seen flying overhead, though she tends not to bother mortal men and women unless she feels sufficiently slighted. 

Vyriss is well regarded as reclusive, and many know very little of her. Many of those who believe themselves powerful enough regard her with envoys, aiming to butter up or seduce this mighty foe.

She ignores them all, or replies with scathing remarks.

Kira is a young girl, appearing to be ten years old, who knows a lot more than most children of her age would.

That is, Kira has an awareness that veers into the supernatural. One that demonstrates itself by calling out the PC's, knowing who they are and what they are. What their stories are, and what they need to accomplish.

Kira has mousey-brown hair, with large white clothes that bear a similarity to Heros' cultural clothes.

She notes that Garrow's forestry is fucked, for example. And that Conn needs to talk to his Father, his own ancestor. Also that The Disciple was a Darkspawn.

Kira played with Timothy to heart's content, until Aziza and Timothy had to leave for the rest of the city.

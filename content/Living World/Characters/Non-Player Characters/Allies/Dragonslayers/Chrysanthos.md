![[Chyrsanthos.webp]]

Chrysanthos is a Silver Spartoi Dragonslayer, originally found by The Party at [[The Atlas/Supernatural/Iolth's Lair]] in [[The Atlas/Natural/Forestry/Kir Forest]]. Chrysanthos is a self-described as arrogant and cocksure, and believed he could take on Iolth.

Instead, Iolth overcame him with ease, and Chrysanthos was left for death- at times tortured by the sadistic black dragon.

Chrysanthos was rescued after hot debate about the best course of action, and brought back to the Golden Moth Freakshow. There, he was healed up by [[Tiffany]], and then sought to rest for a period of time.

His injuries were extensive, but he suggested that The Party travel to sire to find other Dragonslayers.

Chrysanthos joined them, though he has largely been quiet, still attempting to rest from his injuries. After a day's travel in the wagon, he reached Fivakumaaru along with everyone else. 

Chrysanthos' time with the party was unfortunately short in the end, with the spartoi seemingly falling to a higher power. After a lengthy and tense battle with the hunter known as [[Drazekund]], Chrysanthos body was left behind, and the power of [[Vulsumagh, Kingslayer]] left his form.

Among the Nilian people, Bastet is a goddess of great import, particularly for the [[Life/Player Options/Lineages/Tabaxi]] and [[Life/Player Options/Lineages/Ugallu]]. 

She represents the Sun, mortal fertility and protection of the young. It is her duty to protect the young, from all threats, from their conception to their adulthood. Sometimes even long after their childhood.

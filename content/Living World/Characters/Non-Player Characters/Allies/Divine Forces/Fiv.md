Fiv is Kira's Mother, and has rendered aid to [[Conn]] and [[Aziza]] as they ran about [[Fivakumaaru (City)]]. She knows a lot about the city, and knows a lot more about various inhabitants. If anyone would make an effective tour guide, it's Fiv. 

Fiv lacks knowledge of the world outside the city, unless it's flooded in on the backs of traders and those with knowledge shared that she has not. 

Fiv guided Conn and Aziza into the [[Fivakumaaru (City)#Nellie McKnight Museum]].

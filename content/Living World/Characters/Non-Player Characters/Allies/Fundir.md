Fundir is a Zwerg bartender. They work in the guildhall in Kir. He met the adventuring party when [[Life/Characters/Non-Player Characters/Neutrals/Chione]] called him down to serve food and drinks. 

Fundir returned to his room shortly after, and didn't come down again until later. 

When the time came, Fundir accepted the call to adventure put forth by [[-DM Screen/-The Party/Conn]] and his warpicks. 

As such, he has been a part of the Party ever since, playing host to the spirit of the long-dead king.

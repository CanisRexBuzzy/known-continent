![[Arianne.webp]]

Arrian is a [[Mittil]] woman who most notably can transform into a bear. 

Arrian first appeared as [[Irsa]] and [[Seikiri]] were seeking Goodberries for the purposes of feeding the Carnival. 

Arrian offered them both Croesids up front to kill Bandits. And they offered additional pay after the fact, if they were successful. 

Arrian was privy to the events with [[Iolth, the Dark]], when the party had found themselves at his lair. She was part of the effort to rescue [[Chrysanthos]], and at one point took the effort to flirt with Garrow. 

Whilst the party slept, Arrian sacked Raj's tent, and moved on to her next personal adventure.

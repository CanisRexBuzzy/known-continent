A [[DM Screen/CLI/Compendium/bestiary/undead/vampire|vampire]], he is one of the important people in [[House Darius]] of entertainment fame. His exact positioning within House Darius is as of yet unknown to the party, but he is clearly of some standing.

Darius demonstrated he wasn't afraid to dress down [[Jordan Berg]] for his demeanour. He finds their edginess and self-hatred to be boring and frustrating, rather than helpful. Not to mention his aggressive tendencies. As such, Hassan will square up to him- and others.

No matter, Hassan invited the party to meet him at [[Scarlet Casino]], so they could better discuss [[The Tireless Cathedral]], and its willing forces of Vampiric evil.

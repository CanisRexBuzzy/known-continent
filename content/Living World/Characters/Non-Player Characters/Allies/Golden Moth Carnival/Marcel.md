Marcel is a tumbling clown, with a strange personality intended to confound, frustrate and entertain. He likes to offer flowers that explode in smoke.

[[Kassandra]] has offered to shove a flute up their arse.

Marcel baffled and bewildered [[-DM Screen/-The Party/Conn]], leading them to turn away and seek conversation elsewhere. Instead, Marcel followed and shoved flowers into their face. 

A gust of wind from [[-DM Screen/-The Party/Garrow]], sent Marcel tumbling over to Jordan. Again, he offered up flowers and then disappeared when smoke erupted. 

Kassandra soon pursued him.

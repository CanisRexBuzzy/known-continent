![[Marina.webp]]

Mirina is also known by another name, The Moth Queen. She is responsible for operating as the Carnival 'Fortune Teller', but this is front enforced by Raj. 

In truth she is there to be a freak. An attraction for the masses. 

She is a notable artist, and regularly inks her fellow Carnies and friends. She is quite talented, and her status as an artist could be legendary if she wasn't hidden away. 

She has disapproved of Conn after he slew [[Ringmaster Raj|Raj]]. She needed him alive to uncover the truth of where she came from, and how to return to her home plane. 

As such, [[-DM Screen/-The Party/Garrow]] and [[-DM Screen/-The Party/Irsa]] are on a quest to find the information they seek, so that Mirina can potentially find Bec, Conn's wife. 

Mirina gave Irsa her wagon, and said her goodbyes when the time came.

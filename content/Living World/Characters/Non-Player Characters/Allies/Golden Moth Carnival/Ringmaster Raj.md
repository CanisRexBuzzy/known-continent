Raj was the owner of the Golden Moth Freakshow. Described as fat, repugnant and with beady eyes. He was an unkind individual, who belittled, tortured and used his 'Freaks' for all manner of purposes, both financial and personal. 

Raj's time knowing the party was very shortlived, when Conn tricked him into holding a war pick.

Subsuming Raj's will allowed him to kill rhe ringmaster with a single blow to the forehead. 

With Raj's death, his freaks were suddenly very free.

Unfortunately knowledge of Mirina's previous life died with him.

Harold is a Tiger Shark who lives with the other cast and crew of the Golden Moth Carnival. When Raj was the owner, the Circus was used as a Freak Show.

Being telepathic, Harold was a premier attraction. This ability has served him well in enabling him to speak to everyone and provide comfort.

After all, who doesn't love an adorable talking shark?

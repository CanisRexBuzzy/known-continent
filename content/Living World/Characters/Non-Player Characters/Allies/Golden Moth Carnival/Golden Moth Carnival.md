The Golden Moth Carnival was known as the Golden Moth Freakshow, named in part for Mirina. Raj set up this place to delight in his more abusive ideals, but it ultimately allows for him to make money off the backs of others.

When Raj was killed, the crew changed the name, and pointed it to more kindly ideals. 

When they were left behind at [[Fivakumaaru#Kir|Kir]], they planned to stay for a while. This would enable them to plan out their new future, and provide a stable home for the time being. To the benefit of Kir, ultimately.

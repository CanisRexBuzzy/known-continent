title: Welcome to the Known Continent
---

Welcome!

This website tracks the initial and, hopefully, subsequent campaigns of the Known Continent. It is a sprawling landmass of cliff faces, mountain ranges and deep scars in the earth. 

Here, the gods of Earth have power. Directing mortals in their images, and doing their best to avoid the conflicts that plague them all.

Ancient eras mark the advancements and collapses of Men, Alp, Spartoi, Peri and far more. Their histories forever earmarked, inches away from being lost completely. The gods have long lives, but their memories are short, and history is often hidden even to them. 

If you're here by accident, then I hope that my world can be of use to you in some form for your own creative machinations. That it would alight the fire in your mind, and bring something new and fun to the mundane.

If you're one of my players, I hope this site continues to serve as a useful repository of information.
